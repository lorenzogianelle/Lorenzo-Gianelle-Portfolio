SCOTLAND ROAD TRAFFIC DATA ANALYSIS

OVERVIEW
This project analyzes road traffic data in Scotland, focusing on mobility trends before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is divided into three key sections:

-Wheels in Motion (WIM): A COVID-Era Analysis of Scotlandâ€™s Vehicle Density and Mobility Trends
-Busiest Road in Scotland: Identifying Key Traffic Flow Routes
-The Anglo-Scottish Border: Cross-Border Traffic Patterns and Trends
The analysis utilizes road traffic data, mobility reports, and visualization techniques to assess changes in travel behavior and infrastructure utilization.

ðŸš© Section 1: Wheels in Motion (WIM)

A COVID-Era Analysis of Scotlandâ€™s Vehicle Density and Mobility Trends
Key Areas of Analysis:
Vehicle density trends across different transport modes.
Bicycle activity analysis: Impact of COVID-19 on outdoor exercise.
Heavy vehicle trends: Logistics operations during the pandemic.
Spatial density analysis using maps and Google Mobility data.
Insights:
A significant drop in overall vehicle traffic during COVID-19 lockdowns.
Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) remained stable due to essential logistics.
Pedal cycle usage surged, reflecting a shift toward sustainable mobility.
Google mobility data reveals long-term trends in workplace and transit station usage.

ðŸš© Section 2: Busiest Road in Scotland

Identifying Key Traffic Flow Routes
Objective: Identify Scotlandâ€™s busiest roads and analyze traffic trends.
Methods: Data visualization, traffic density mapping, and peak hour analysis.
Findings: High-traffic regions and their correlation with economic hubs.

ðŸš© Section 3: The Anglo-Scottish Border
Cross-Border Traffic Patterns and Trends
Objective: Understand cross-border mobility between Scotland and England.
Methods: Traffic count analysis, peak travel periods, and travel behavior shifts.
Findings: Border restrictions during COVID-19 impacted commuting patterns.


SKILLS

This project employed a range of data science and analytics skills, including:

-Data Processing & Analysis
	Handling and cleaning large datasets using Pandas.
	Time series analysis to track traffic fluctuations over different periods.
	Statistical methods to identify patterns in traffic density.

-Data Visualization
	Creating heatmaps to visualize traffic flow using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
	Generating line graphs and bar charts to illustrate trends in vehicle movement.
	Geospatial analysis using Folium and GeoPandas for mapping traffic intensity.

-Spatial Analysis
	Mapping traffic congestion hotspots using GIS-based methods.
	Incorporating Google Mobility data to compare real-world movement trends.
